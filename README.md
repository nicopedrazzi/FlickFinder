Been scrolling for hours? Don't know what to watch and your little free time got consumed by deciding which film or tv series to watch? Well, this simple CLI tool help you by giving you discovery options, summary and finally taking little time to select a film.

Current commands`(if python doesn't work, use python3):

before all, be sure to run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
If you don't know what to watch... go pure random (note: this will fetch also unknown niche stuff... NOICE)
```python3 main.py random```
If you want to know the most watched at the moment
```python main.py discover```
If you want to search for a specific movie or tv show
```python main.py search```

In case you need help, run ```python main.py -h```
